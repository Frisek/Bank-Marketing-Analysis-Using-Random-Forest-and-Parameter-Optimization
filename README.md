# Bank-Marketing-Analysis-Using-Random-Forest-and-Parameter-Optimization
 Meta-classifiers and Parameter Optimization
This project shows an example of using Random Forest for multi-variable regression. We explore a bank marketing dataset and build a model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. We start with some data exploration and preprocessing steps, and then train a Random Forest model with optimized hyperparameters using cross-validation. Finally, we evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results.

We also compare the Random Forest model with a Logistic Regression model and a simple Decision Tree, to highlight the advantages of using an ensemble method for this problem.

This project is a great way to learn about machine learning techniques for classification and regression, and how to apply them to real-world datasets. The code is written in Python, and we use popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Feel free to check out the code and try it out with your own datasets!
